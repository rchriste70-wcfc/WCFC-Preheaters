**Wings of Carolina Flying Club**

This repository contains the governance and planning artifacts for the
Wings of Carolina Flying Club Aircraft Preheater Program.

The program is designed to ensure safe cold-weather operations, protect
club aircraft assets, and provide a durable, role-based framework that
can be handed off cleanly between volunteers over time.
