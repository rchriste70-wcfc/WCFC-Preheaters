# WCFC-Preheaters
All artifacts to support the Preheater program for WCFC

Artifacts may consist of PDFs, email tmeplates, QR Codes, etc.

In addition, there will be backing documentation for the processes to be followed by the Key Volunteer for preheaters @ WCFC.   A defined calendar of events should also be documented in some form which may be used every year for ensuring communications with club members occur in a timely manner, in addition to certain maintenance events.
